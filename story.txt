There once was a guy named John.  John went to the store to buy apples.  When he got there, here weren't any left, though.  In a panic, he had to figure out what to do.
So he stormed out of the store and went to another store nearby. But, they didn't had any apples too. He was frustrated that either of the stores in his town did not had any apples left. He had to figure out what to do.
So John went to look for apple seeds in the nearby store. He bought them and planted the apple seeds into his backyard. Only to realize after many years of waiting for his tree to grow so he could get some apples, that it didn't grow apples. Instead it grew a new fruit with a mix between a banana and a kiwi, making a baniwi. He was furious, he only had baniwis instead of his beloved apples he waited oh so dearly for.
