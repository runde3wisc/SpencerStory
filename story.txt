There once was a guy named John.  John went to the store to buy apples.  When he got there, here weren't any left, though.  In a panic, he had to figure out what to do.
So he stormed out of the store and went to another store nearby. But, they didn't had any apples too. He was frustrated that either of the stores in his town did not had any apples left. He had to figure out what to do.
